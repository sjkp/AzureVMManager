<h1>AzureDeploymentManager</h1>

<p>AzureDeployment manager is a set of tools, built on top of the Microsoft Azure Management API that makes it easy to provision and deprovision Cloud Services. </p>

<p>The purpose of the project was to build a simple REST service that can be called from Azure Scheduling service that will deploy a cloud service.</p>

<h1>To get Started</h1>

<ul>
<li>run npm install to get all the packages</li>
<li>create an ".env" file (for environment variables) in the root of application, and added the following two lines<br/>
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=[NAME_OF_STORAGEACCOUNT]<br/>
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=[STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY]</li>
<li>get your subscription certificate by running "azure account cert export" from a command line with the node azure-cli tools installed. If you havn't downloaded and setup your subscription you have to do the following first</li>
<li>npm install azure-cli -g</li>
<li>azure account download (download the subscription file)</li>
<li>azure account import [path_to_subscription]</li>
</ul>

<p>In your storage account, in the blob storage you have to create a container "deployments" in this folder you must upload the *.cscfg and *.cspkg file of your cloud service. <br/>
Also be sure to change the code in route\cloudservice.js to reflect the name of your cloudservice and subscription file.</p>
